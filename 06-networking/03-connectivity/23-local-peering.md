### **Study Notes: OCI Local VCN Peering - Part 1**

---

#### **1. What is VCN Peering?**

**VCN Peering** establishes **private network connectivity** between Virtual Cloud Networks, enabling resources in different VCNs to communicate using **private IP addresses** without traversing the public internet.

*   **Private Communication:** Instances communicate via private IPs, not public IPs
*   **Two Types:** Local VCN Peering (same region) and Remote VCN Peering (different regions)
*   **Security:** Traffic stays on Oracle's private backbone network

---

#### **2. VCN Communication Options**

##### **A. Public Internet Communication:**
*   **Method:** Instances use public IP addresses
*   **Path:** Traffic traverses public internet
*   **Security Risk:** Exposure to internet threats
*   **Use Case:** Generally avoided for internal VCN communication

##### **B. Private Peering Communication:**
*   **Method:** Instances use private IP addresses
*   **Path:** Traffic stays on Oracle's private network
*   **Security:** Enhanced security through network isolation
*   **Use Case:** Recommended for internal VCN-to-VCN communication

---

#### **3. Local VCN Peering Implementation Methods**

OCI provides **two approaches** for local VCN peering:

##### **A. Local Peering Gateway (LPG) Approach**
*   **Components:** Dedicated LPG in each VCN
*   **Capacity:** Each VCN can have **up to 10 LPGs**
*   **Performance:** **Extremely high bandwidth** with **super low latency**
*   **Use Case:** Direct VCN-to-VCN connectivity within same region

##### **B. Upgraded Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG) Approach**
*   **Components:** Single DRG with multiple VCN attachments
*   **Capacity:** One DRG can support **up to 300 VCN attachments**
*   **Flexibility:** **Advanced routing capabilities** and policy control
*   **Use Case:** Complex routing scenarios, hub-and-spoke architectures

---

#### **4. Gateway Capacity and Limitations**

##### **Local Peering Gateway (LPG):**
*   **Per VCN Limit:** **10 LPGs** maximum per VCN
*   **One-to-One:** Each LPG connects to one peer LPG
*   **Simple Architecture:** Straightforward point-to-point connectivity

##### **Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG):**
*   **Attachment Limit:** **300 VCN attachments** per DRG
*   **One-to-Many:** Single DRG can connect multiple VCNs
*   **Complex Routing:** Supports advanced routing policies and BGP

---

*   **Complex Architectures:** Use upgraded DRG for multiple VCNs and advanced routing

---

#### **7. Practical Architecture Examples**

##### **LPG-based Peering:**
```
Region: US-East
├── VCN-A (10.0.0.0/16)
│   └── LPG-A (peers with LPG-B)
└── VCN-B (10.1.0.0/16)
    └── LPG-B (peers with LPG-A)
```

##### **DRG-based Peering:**
```
Region: US-East
├── VCN-A (10.0.0.0/16)
├── VCN-B (10.1.0.0/16)
├── VCN-C (10.2.0.0/16)
└── Dynamic Routing Gateway
    ├── Attachment to VCN-A
    ├── Attachment to VCN-B
    └── Attachment to VCN-C
```

---

#### **Key Design Considerations**

*   **Performance Priority:** Choose LPG for maximum bandwidth and lowest latency
*   **Scalability Needs:** Choose DRG when connecting more than 2 VCNs or planning future expansion
*   **Routing Complexity:** Choose DRG for advanced routing policies, BGP, or transit routing
*   **Cost Optimization:** Evaluate both options based on specific use case requirements
*   **Future Growth:** Consider long-term architecture evolution when selecting peering method

**Remember:** Local VCN peering provides **secure, high-performance private connectivity** between VCNs in the same region, with two implementation options tailored for different performance, scalability, and routing requirements.



### **Study Notes: OCI Local VCN Peering - Part 2 (Implementation)**

---

#### **1. Prerequisites for Local VCN Peering**

##### **A. CIDR Requirements:**
*   **Non-Overlapping IP Ranges:** VCNs must have completely separate CIDR blocks
*   **Example Valid Configuration:**
    *   VCN 1: `10.0.0.0/16`
    *   VCN 2: `192.168.0.0/16`
*   **Example Invalid Configuration:**
    *   VCN 1: `10.0.0.0/16`
    *   VCN 2: `10.0.1.0/24` (overlaps with VCN 1)

##### **B. Regional Constraint:**
*   Both VCNs must be in the **same OCI region**
*   Cross-region connectivity requires **Remote VCN Peering**

---

#### **2. Method 1: Local Peering Gateway (LPG) Approach**

##### **A. Architecture Components:**
```
Region: US-East
├── VCN 1 (10.0.0.0/16)
│   └── Local Peering Gateway 1
└── VCN 2 (192.168.0.0/16)
    └── Local Peering Gateway 2
Connection: LPG 1 ↔ LPG 2
```

##### **B. Implementation Steps:**
1.  **Create LPGs:** Deploy one LPG in each VCN
2.  **Establish Connection:** Connect LPG 1 to LPG 2
3.  **Configure Routing:** Add route table entries in both VCNs
4.  **Set Security Rules:** Configure security lists/NSGs for traffic control

##### **C. Route Table Configuration:**
**VCN 1 Route Table:**
```
Destination: 192.168.0.0/16 → Target: Local Peering Gateway 1
```

**VCN 2 Route Table:**
```
Destination: 10.0.0.0/16 → Target: Local Peering Gateway 2
```

---

#### **3. Method 2: Upgraded Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG) Approach**

##### **A. Architecture Components:**
```
Region: US-East
├── VCN 1 (10.0.0.0/16)
├── VCN 2 (192.168.0.0/16)
└── Dynamic Routing Gateway (Single Instance)
    ├── VCN Attachment 1 (to VCN 1)
    └── VCN Attachment 2 (to VCN 2)
```

##### **B. Implementation Steps:**
1.  **Create DRG:** Deploy one upgraded DRG in the region
2.  **Attach VCNs:** Connect both VCNs to the same DRG
3.  **Configure Routing:** Add route table entries pointing to DRG
4.  **Set Security Rules:** Configure traffic control policies

##### **C. Route Table Configuration:**
**VCN 1 Route Table:**
```
Destination: 192.168.0.0/16 → Target: Dynamic Routing Gateway
```

**VCN 2 Route Table:**
```
Destination: 10.0.0.0/16 → Target: Dynamic Routing Gateway
```

---

#### **4. Critical Configuration Requirements**

##### **A. Route Tables (Both Methods):**
*   **Bidirectional Routing:** Routes required in **both VCNs**
*   **Specific CIDRs:** Target the peer VCN's exact CIDR block
*   **Gateway Targets:** Point to LPG or DRG as appropriate

##### **B. Security Rules:**
*   **Security Lists:** Subnet-level firewall rules
*   **Network Security Groups:** Resource-level granular control
*   **Bidirectional Access:** Typically need rules in both directions

**Example Security List Rules:**
```
VCN 1 Security List:
- Ingress: Allow TCP from 192.168.0.0/16
- Egress: Allow TCP to 192.168.0.0/16

VCN 2 Security List:  
- Ingress: Allow TCP from 10.0.0.0/16
- Egress: Allow TCP to 10.0.0.0/16
```

---

#### **5. Internet Gateway Sharing Restriction**

##### **Critical Limitation:**
*   **Outbound Internet:** Instances **CANNOT use** internet gateway from peered VCN
*   **Inbound Internet:** Instances **CAN receive** traffic via peered VCN's internet gateway

**Example Scenario:**
```
VCN 1: Has Internet Gateway
VCN 2: No Internet Gateway (peered with VCN 1)

Result:
- VCN 2 instances CANNOT initiate outbound internet via VCN 1's IGW
- VCN 2 instances CAN receive inbound internet via VCN 1's IGW
```

---

#### **6. Alternative Without Peering**

##### **Public Internet Communication:**
*   **Requirement:** Internet Gateway + Public IPs for instances
*   **Path:** Traffic traverses public internet
*   **Security Risk:** Exposure to internet threats
*   **Performance:** Higher latency, variable bandwidth
*   **Cost:** Data transfer charges apply

---

#### **Key Implementation Principles**

*   **CIDR Planning:** Essential to avoid overlapping IP ranges
*   **Bidirectional Configuration:** Routes and security rules needed in both VCNs
*   **Gateway Selection:** Choose LPG for simplicity, DRG for scalability
*   **Internet Access:** Each VCN needs its own internet gateway for outbound access
*   **Security First:** Implement least-privilege security rules
*   **Testing:** Validate connectivity after configuration

**Remember:** Local VCN peering provides **secure, high-performance private connectivity** between VCNs in the same region, but requires careful planning of IP addressing, routing, and security policies to ensure successful implementation.
