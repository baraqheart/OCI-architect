### **OCI Study Notes: Private DNS Views**

#### **1. Core Definition**

*   A **Private DNS View** is a logical container for **grouping and organizing Private DNS Zones**.
*   Think of it as a folder that holds a collection of related zones, allowing for structured management of your private DNS data.

#### **2. Key Characteristics and Rules**

*   **One Zone, One View:** A single Private DNS Zone **can belong to only one view**. It cannot be a member of multiple views simultaneously.
*   **Default View:** Every VCN's Private DNS Resolver comes with a pre-existing **default view**. You can add zones directly to this default view.
*   **Custom Views:** You can create and attach **additional custom views** to a resolver, in addition to the default view.
*   **View Sharing:** A single, custom private view **can be attached to multiple resolvers** across different VCNs. This is a key mechanism for sharing DNS data.

#### **3. Purpose and Function**

*   The primary purpose of attaching a view (whether default or custom) to a resolver is to make the zones and their records **resolvable within the VCN**.
*   By attaching the same custom view to resolvers in **different VCNs**, you enable **cross-VCN DNS resolution**, allowing instances in separate VCNs to resolve each other's hostnames defined in the shared zones.
