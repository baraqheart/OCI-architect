### **OCI Study Notes: DNS Zones**

#### **1. What is a DNS Zone?**

*   **Definition:** A **DNS zone** is a distinct, administratively managed portion of the DNS namespace.
*   **Purpose:** It provides **granular control** over the DNS components for a specific domain and its subdomains, including the management of authoritative name servers and all associated DNS records.
*   **Content:** A zone contains the **trusted, authoritative DNS records** (such as A, AAAA, MX, CNAME) for the domain. These records reside on and are served by OCI's name servers.

#### **2. Automatic Zone Records**

When you create a zone in OCI, the service automatically generates two critical record types:

*   **Nameserver (NS) Records:** These specify the authoritative OCI name servers that are responsible for hosting and serving the zone's DNS records.
*   **Start of Authority (SOA) Record:** This contains essential administrative information about the zone, including the primary name server, the responsible administrator's email, and various timers that control zone propagation and refreshing.

#### **3. OCI Zone Types**

OCI offers two types of zones to serve different networking contexts:

*   **Public Zone:**
    *   **Purpose:** Holds the **trusted, public DNS records** for domains that are accessible from the **public internet** (e.g., your company's public website).
    *   **Resolution:** These records are resolved by OCI's global, public-facing name servers.

*   **Private Zone:**
    *   **Purpose:** Contains DNS records for domain names that should **only resolve within your Virtual Cloud Network (VCN)** and connected private networks (via FastConnect or VPN).
    *   **Use Case:** Allows you to use custom, friendly domain names (e.g., `db01.corp.internal`) for your internal resources without exposing them to the internet.
