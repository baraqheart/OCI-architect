### **OCI Study Notes: Private DNS Zone**

#### **1. DNS Resolution Options in a VCN**

Before Private DNS, there were two primary methods for DNS resolution within a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN):

*   **1. Internet and VCN Resolver (Default):**
    *   **Internet Resolver:** Allows instances to resolve publicly available hostnames on the internet.
    *   **VCN Resolver:** Allows instances to resolve the hostnames of other instances **within the same VCN** using their automatically assigned Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs).

*   **2. Custom Resolver:**
    *   Allows you to configure your own DNS servers. These servers can be located on the internet, within your VCN, or in your on-premises data center.

*   **3. Private DNS (The Focus of This Lesson):**
    *   A managed OCI service that provides enhanced DNS resolution capabilities beyond the default VCN resolver.

#### **2. Capabilities of Private DNS**

Private DNS extends hostname resolution to a broader scope:

*   **Within a VCN:** (Same as the default VCN resolver).
*   **Across VCNs:** Enables instances in different VCNs to resolve each other's hostnames.
*   **Between VCN and On-Premises:** Allows resolution between resources in your VCN and resources in your on-premises network or other connected private networks.

#### **3. Core Components of Private DNS**

Private DNS is built on four key, hierarchical resources.

**1. Private DNS Resolver**
*   **Definition:** The core service component that **serves responses to DNS queries within the VCN**. It holds the entire DNS configuration.
*   **Analogy:** The "brain" of the Private DNS service.

**2. Private DNS View**
*   **Definition:** A **collection of private DNS zones**. Each view represents a specific perspective of the DNS namespace.
*   **Relationship:** A resolver contains one or more views. A zone can belong to only one view.

**3. Private DNS Zone**
*   **Definition:** A container that holds the **actual DNS record data** for a specific domain (e.g., `corp.internal`).
*   **Relationship:** A view contains one or more zones.

**4. Private DNS Records**
*   **Definition:** The individual entries inside a zone that map names to IP addresses.
*   **Supported Types:** Includes standard records like **A** (hostname to IPv4), **AAAA** (hostname to IPv6), and **PTR** (reverse lookup).

**Hierarchy Summary:** **Resolver -> View -> Zone -> Records**

#### **4. Private DNS Resolver Endpoints**

Endpoints enable communication between the Private DNS resolver and other networks. They consume private IP addresses in their host subnet.

*   **Listening Resolver Endpoint:**
    *   **Purpose:** To **respond to DNS queries originating from outside the VCN** (e.g., from an on-premises network over a FastConnect or VPN connection).
    *   **Function:** It "listens" for incoming queries.

*   **Forwarding Resolver Endpoint:**
    *   **Purpose:** To **redirect (forward) DNS queries to different, specified DNS servers** (e.g., to on-premises DNS servers for resolving internal corporate names).
    *   **Function:** It uses defined rules to send queries to their next destination.

**Example Workflow:**
*   An on-premises server queries an OCI instance's hostname. The query is sent to the **Listening Endpoint** in OCI, which responds with the instance's private IP.
*   An OCI instance queries an on-premises server's hostname. The query is sent to the **Forwarding Endpoint** in OCI, which forwards it to an on-premises DNS server for resolution.
