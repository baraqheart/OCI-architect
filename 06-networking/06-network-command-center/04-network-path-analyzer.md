### **OCI Study Notes: Network Path Analyzer**

#### **1. Core Function and Purpose**

*   **What it is:** A troubleshooting tool within the Network Command Center that **identifies the root cause of connectivity problems** in your virtual network.
*   **How it Works:** It performs an **automated configuration analysis** by examining your networking constructs. It does **not send actual traffic**.
*   **Key Analysis Points:** It checks:
    *   **Routing Rules** (Route Tables)
    *   **Security Rules** (Security Lists, Network Security Groups)

#### **2. Key Features**

*   **Hop-by-Hop Visualization:** Provides a detailed, step-by-step visual path of how traffic would flow from source to destination, highlighting each component (subnet, gateway, etc.).
*   **Bidirectional and Unidirectional Analysis:** Can analyze the path in one direction (source to destination) or both directions (forward and return path) to fully diagnose issues.
*   **Broad Scenario Support:** Can analyze connectivity for:
    *   Resources **within OCI** (e.g., instance to instance, across VCNs).
    *   Between **OCI and on-premises** networks (via FastConnect/DRG).
    *   Between **OCI and the internet**.
    *   Connectivity to **Oracle Services** via a Service Gateway or Private Endpoint.
*   **Cost:** The service is **free of charge**. There is no cost for running analyses.

#### **3. How It Identifies Problems: Example Scenarios**

**Scenario 1: Cross-VCN Communication Failure**
*   **Setup:** An instance in one VCN tries to connect to an instance in another VCN, with both VCNs attached to a Dynamic Routing Gateway (DRG).
*   **Problem Identified:** The Network Path Analyzer can pinpoint that a **misconfigured Security List** on the target subnet is **denying the traffic** from the DRG, resulting in an "unreachable" status.

**Scenario 2: Internet Access Failure**
*   **Setup:** A resource in OCI tries to reach a public internet address (e.g., Google's DNS).
*   **Problem Identified:** The tool can identify two common issues:
    1.  **No route configured** to an Internet Gateway or NAT Gateway.
    2.  An **egress security rule is blocking** access to the specific public IP.

#### **4. Primary Use Cases**

*   **Troubleshooting Outages:** Rapidly diagnose routing and security misconfigurations that are causing network outages, **significantly reducing resolution time (MTTR)**.
*   **Pre-Deployment Validation:** Perform **on-demand validation** of network paths **before deploying production applications**. This ensures the connectivity setup matches your intent and avoids deployment delays caused by last-minute network issues.
*   **Proactive Verification:** Regularly verify that network routing and security policies are correctly configured, ensuring ongoing compliance and intended access control.
