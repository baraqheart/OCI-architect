### **Study Notes: OCI Dynamic Groups - Non-Human Identity Management**

---

#### **1. Core Concepts and Definitions**

**Principal:** The identity of any caller (human or machine) trying to access or operate on an OCI resource.

**Resource Principal Patterns in OCI:**

*   **Infrastructure Principal:** A provisioned resource (like a compute instance) that can be authorized to perform actions on other services.
    *   **Analogy:** A birth certificate proving existence
    *   **Example:** A compute instance calling Object Storage

*   **Stacked Principal:** One principal projecting permissions onto another resource.
    *   **Analogy:** Having a passport that enables international travel
    *   **Example:** A database making calls to Object Storage for backups

*   **Ephemeral Principal:** Temporary credentials with limited lifespan.
    *   **Analogy:** A temporary day-pass badge
    *   **Example:** Functions with time-limited access to other services

#### **2. What are Dynamic Groups?**

**Dynamic Groups** enable grouping of **non-human resource principals** (compute instances, databases, functions, etc.) as "principal actors," similar to how user groups organize human users.

*   **Purpose:** Allow cloud resources to make API calls against OCI services
*   **Key Differentiator:** **Dynamic membership** based on matching rules rather than manual user assignment
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Instances calling Object Storage
    *   Databases accessing Vault service
    *   Functions calling other OCI services

#### **3. Dynamic Group Implementation Workflow**

##### **Step 1: Create Dynamic Group with Matching Rules**
Define membership using rules that automatically include/exclude resources based on attributes:

*   **Compartment-Based Rule:** `ALL {resource.compartment.id = 'ocid1.compartment.unique_id'}`
*   **Instance-Specific Rule:** `ALL {instance.id = 'ocid1.instance.unique_id'}`
*   **Resource Type Rule:** `ALL {resource.type = 'dbaas', resource.compartment.id = 'compartment_ocid'}`
*   **Function-Based Rule:** `ALL {resource.type = 'fnfunc', resource.compartment.id = 'compartment_ocid'}`

**Key Benefit:** Membership updates automatically as resources are created/deleted in the specified compartments - no manual maintenance required.

##### **Step 2: Write Policies for Dynamic Groups**
Create IAM policies that grant permissions to the dynamic group using the `dynamicgroup` keyword:

*   **Basic Syntax:** `ALLOW DYNAMICGROUP <domain>/<group-name> TO <actions> IN <placement>`
*   **Advanced Syntax with Conditions:** 
    ```plaintext
    ALLOW DYNAMICGROUP <domain>/<group-name> TO <actions> IN <placement>
    WHERE <additional-conditions>
    ```

#### **4. Practical Implementation Examples**

##### **Example 1: Instance to Object Storage Access**
**Scenario:** Allow all compute instances in the "Backup-Compartment" to manage objects in a specific bucket.

**Step 1: Dynamic Group Creation**
*   **Group Name:** `Instance-To-Storage`
*   **Matching Rule:** `ALL {resource.compartment.id = 'ocid1.compartment.backup_compartment_id'}`

**Step 2: Policy Creation**
```plaintext
ALLOW DYNAMICGROUP default/Instance-To-Storage TO MANAGE objects IN TENANCY
WHERE target.bucket.name = 'backup-bucket' AND request.region = 'us-phoenix-1'
```

##### **Example 2: Database Backup to Object Storage**
**Scenario:** Allow databases to manage backup objects across the tenancy.

**Step 1: Dynamic Group Creation**
*   **Group Name:** `DatabaseBackUp`
*   **Matching Rule:** `ALL {resource.type = 'dbaas', resource.compartment.id = 'ocid1.compartment.prod_id'}`

**Step 2: Policy Creation**
```plaintext
ALLOW DYNAMICGROUP default/DatabaseBackUp TO MANAGE objects IN TENANCY
WHERE target.bucket.name = 'database-backups'
```

##### **Example 3: Function Access to Multiple Services**
**Scenario:** Allow serverless functions to use both Object Storage and Vault services.

**Step 1: Dynamic Group Creation**
*   **Group Name:** `Function-Services`
*   **Matching Rule:** `ALL {resource.type = 'fnfunc', resource.compartment.id = 'ocid1.compartment.functions_id'}`

**Step 2: Policy Creation**
```plaintext
ALLOW DYNAMICGROUP default/Function-Services TO USE objects IN TENANCY
ALLOW DYNAMICGROUP default/Function-Services TO READ secrets IN TENANCY
```

#### **5. Critical Implementation Notes**

*   **No Automatic Permissions:** Dynamic groups without associated policies have **no access rights**
*   **Rule Evaluation:** Membership is determined in real-time based on current resource attributes
*   **Security Scope:** Policies can be scoped with conditions for specific buckets, regions, or resource types
*   **Audit Trail:** All API calls made by dynamic group members are logged and traceable

#### **Key Terminology & Operational Facts**

*   **Dynamic Groups** manage **non-human resource principals**
*   Membership is defined by **matching rules**, not manual assignment
*   The workflow is: **1. Create Dynamic Group → 2. Define Matching Rules → 3. Write Policies**
*   Policy syntax uses the **`dynamicgroup`** keyword instead of `group`
*   **Matching rules** can target: compartment IDs, specific resource IDs, resource types, or combinations
*   Dynamic groups enable **zero-touch membership management** as infrastructure changes
*   Always apply **principle of least privilege** when writing policies for dynamic groups
