### **OCI Study Notes: Compute Advanced - Module Introduction**

#### **1. Module Overview**

This module covers advanced concepts and services for managing and optimizing your OCI compute instances, focusing on scalability, management, and specialized configurations.

#### **2. Key Topics Covered**

*   **Scaling Concepts:**
    *   **Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up/Down):** Changing the shape (CPU/Memory) of an existing instance.
    *   **Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out/In):** Adding or removing instances to a pool. This includes a deep dive into **Autoscaling** for automatic horizontal scaling based on metrics.

*   **Management Services:**
    *   **OS Management Service:** For patching and package management of instances.
    *   **Run Command:** For remotely executing commands on instances at scale.
    *   **Console Connections:** For gaining terminal access to instances.

*   **Infrastructure Maintenance:** Understanding how OCI handles platform and infrastructure updates that may affect your instances.

*   **Burstable Instances:** A specific instance type designed for workloads with variable CPU usage, providing a baseline performance with the ability to burst.
